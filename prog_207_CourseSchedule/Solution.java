    1) Topological Sort Approach:

    We will make indegrees array and adjacency list.
    Here we are maintaining 3 things
    1) Map for maintaining relation between, Independent Node : Dependent list
    2) Add the same time We have an Array where we maintaing How many nodes the current index it dependent.
    3) Queue : Whenever node becomes independent, indegree value of array becomes 0, we will push inside the queue.
    Example: [(1,0), (4,1), (3,2),   (3,1),  (2,0),  (5,4),  (5,2)]
    Map:
    {0 : [1,    2]
     1 : [4,    3]
     2 : [3,    5]
     3 : []
     4 : [5]
     5:  []
    }
    Array:
     0  1   2   3   4   5
    [0, 1,  1,  2,  1 , 2]



    Whoever is becoming independent which means degree in array becomes 0, we will be pushing inside the queue.
    Whenever we are pushing a node inside the queue, we are maintaining a count. We will check is this count is equal
    to total no of courses. We can also check if indegrees arrays all items become zero.

    If we have a cyclic dependency in a graph, we wil not be ablr to proceed further and our output will be false.
    Suppose we have 2 nodes with 0 dependency, since this is bfs, we will add all the nodes, and not any.

    Space Complexity : O(E+V)
